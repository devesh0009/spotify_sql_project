#Overview

This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, 
albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized 
dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing 
query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and 
generate valuable insights from the dataset.
